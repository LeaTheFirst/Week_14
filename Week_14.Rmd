```{r setup, include=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
library(here)

# For text mining:
library(pdftools)
library(tidytext)
library(textdata) 
library(ggwordcloud)

```

## Your task

Taking the Text mining, sentiment analysis, and visualization script as a point of departure, apply sentiment analysis on the Game of Thrones. You will find a pdf in the data folder. What are the most common meaningful words and what emotions do you expect will dominate this volume? Are there any terms that are similarly ambiguous to the 'confidence' above? 

### Get the Game of Thrones pdf
```{r get-document}
got_path <- here("data","got.pdf")
got_text <- pdf_text(got_path)
```

### Some wrangling:

- Split up pages into separate lines (separated by `\n`) using `stringr::str_split()`
- Unnest into regular columns using `tidyr::unnest()`
- Remove leading/trailing white space with `stringr::str_trim()`

```{r split-lines}
got_df <- data.frame(got_text) %>% 
  mutate(text_full = str_split(got_text, pattern = '\n')) %>% 
  unnest(text_full) %>% 
  mutate(text_full = str_trim(text_full)) 

```

Now each line, on each page, is its own row, with extra starting & trailing spaces removed.

### Get the tokens (individual words) in tidy format

Use `tidytext::unnest_tokens()` (which pulls from the `tokenizer`) package, to split columns into tokens. We are interested in *words*, so that's the token we'll use:

```{r tokenize}
got_tokens <- got_df %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, text_full)
got_tokens

```

Let's count the words!
```{r count-words}
got_wc <- got_tokens %>% 
  count(word) %>% 
  arrange(-n)
got_wc
```

OK...so we notice that a whole bunch of things show up frequently that we might not be interested in ("a", "the", "and", etc.). These are called *stop words*. Let's remove them. 

### Remove stop words:

See `?stop_words` and `View(stop_words)`to look at documentation for stop words lexicons.

We will *remove* stop words using `tidyr::anti_join()`:
```{r stopwords}
got_stop <- got_tokens %>% 
  anti_join(stop_words) %>% 
  select(-got_text)
```

Now check the counts again: 
```{r count-words2}
got_swc <- got_stop %>% 
  count(word) %>% 
  arrange(-n)
got_swc
```

What if we want to get rid of all the numbers (non-text) in `ipcc_stop`?
```{r skip-numbers}
# This code will filter out numbers by asking:
# If you convert to as.numeric, is it NA (meaning those words)?
# If it IS NA (is.na), then keep it (so all words are kept)
# Anything that is converted to a number is removed

got_no_numeric <- got_stop %>% 
  filter(is.na(as.numeric(word)))
```

### A word cloud of Game of Thrones words (non-numeric)


```{r wordcloud-prep}
# There are 11209 unique words 
length(unique(got_no_numeric$word))

# We probably don't want to include them all in a word cloud. Let's filter to only include the top 100 most frequent?
got_top100 <- got_no_numeric %>% 
  count(word) %>% 
  arrange(-n) %>% 
  head(100)
```

```{r wordcloud}
got_cloud <- ggplot(data = got_top100, aes(label = word)) +
  geom_text_wordcloud() +
  theme_minimal()

got_cloud
```

That's underwhelming. Let's customize it a bit:
```{r wordcloud-pro}
ggplot(data = got_top100, aes(label = word, size = n)) +
  geom_text_wordcloud_area(aes(color = n), shape = "diamond") +
  scale_size_area(max_size = 12) +
  scale_color_gradientn(colors = c("darkgreen","blue","red")) +
  theme_minimal()
```



### Sentiment analysis

First, check out the ‘sentiments’ lexicon. From Julia Silge and David Robinson (https://www.tidytextmining.com/sentiment.html):

“The three general-purpose lexicons are

  -  AFINN from Finn Årup Nielsen,
  -  bing from Bing Liu and collaborators, and
  -  nrc from Saif Mohammad and Peter Turney

All three of these lexicons are based on unigrams, i.e., single words. These lexicons contain many English words and the words are assigned scores for positive/negative sentiment, and also possibly emotions like joy, anger, sadness, and so forth. The AFINN lexicon assigns words with a score that runs between -5 and 5, with negative scores indicating negative sentiment and positive scores indicating positive sentiment.  The bing lexicon categorizes words in a binary fashion into positive and negative categories. The nrc lexicon categorizes words in a binary fashion (“yes”/“no”) into categories of positive, negative, anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, and trust.  All of this information is tabulated in the sentiments dataset, and tidytext provides a function get_sentiments() to get specific sentiment lexicons without the columns that are not used in that lexicon."

Let's explore the sentiment lexicons. "bing" is included, other lexicons ("afinn", "nrc", "loughran") you'll be prompted to download.

**WARNING:** These collections include very offensive words. I urge you to not look at them in class.

"afinn": Words ranked from -5 (very negative) to +5 (very positive)
```{r afinn}
get_sentiments(lexicon = "afinn")
# Note: may be prompted to download (yes)

# Let's look at the pretty positive words:
afinn_pos <- get_sentiments("afinn") %>% 
  filter(value %in% c(3,4,5))

afinn_pos
```

bing: binary, "positive" or "negative"
```{r bing}
get_sentiments(lexicon = "bing")
```

nrc:https://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/NRC-Emotion-Lexicon.htm
Includes bins for 8 emotions (anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, trust) and positive / negative. 

**Citation for NRC lexicon**: Crowdsourcing a Word-Emotion Association Lexicon, Saif Mohammad and Peter Turney, Computational Intelligence, 29 (3), 436-465, 2013.

Now nrc:
```{r nrc}
get_sentiments(lexicon = "nrc")
```

Let's do sentiment analysis on the IPCC text data using afinn, and nrc. 


### Sentiment analysis with afinn: 

First, bind words in `got_stop` to `afinn` lexicon:
```{r bind-afinn}
got_afinn <- got_stop %>% 
  inner_join(get_sentiments("afinn"))
```

Let's find some counts (by sentiment ranking):
```{r count-afinn}
got_afinn_hist <- got_afinn %>% 
  count(value)

# Plot them: 
ggplot(data = got_afinn_hist, aes(x = value, y = n)) +
  geom_col()
```

Investigate some of the words in a bit more depth:
```{r afinn-4}
# What are these '4' words?
got_afinn4 <- got_afinn %>% 
  filter(value == 4)
got_afinn4

```

```{r afinn-4-more}
# Check the unique 4-score words:
unique(got_afinn4$word)

# Count & plot them
got_afinn4_n <- got_afinn4 %>% 
  count(word, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(word = fct_reorder(factor(word), n))


ggplot(data = got_afinn4_n, aes(x = word, y = n)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip()

```



Or we can summarize sentiment for the report: 
```{r summarize-afinn}
got_summary <- got_afinn %>% 
  summarize(
    mean_score = mean(value),
    median_score = median(value)
  )

got_summary
```

The mean and median indicate somewhat negative overall sentiments based on the AFINN lexicon. 

### NRC lexicon for sentiment analysis

We can use the NRC lexicon to start "binning" text by the feelings they're typically associated with. As above, we'll use inner_join() to combine the IPCC non-stopword text with the nrc lexicon: 

```{r bind-bing}
got_nrc <- got_stop %>% 
  inner_join(get_sentiments("nrc"))
```

We should check which are excluded using `anti_join()`:

```{r check-exclusions}
got_exclude <- got_stop %>% 
  anti_join(get_sentiments("nrc"))

# View(ipcc_exclude)

# Count to find the most excluded:
got_exclude_n <- got_exclude %>% 
  count(word, sort = TRUE)

head(got_exclude_n)
```

**Lesson: always check which words are EXCLUDED in sentiment analysis using a pre-built lexicon! **

Now find some counts: 
```{r count-bing}
got_nrc_n <- got_nrc %>% 
  count(sentiment, sort = TRUE)

# And plot them:

ggplot(data = got_nrc_n, aes(x = sentiment, y = n)) +
  geom_col()
```

Or count by sentiment *and* word, then facet:
```{r count-nrc}
got_nrc_n5 <- got_nrc %>% 
  count(word,sentiment, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  group_by(sentiment) %>% 
  top_n(5) %>% 
  ungroup()

got_nrc_gg <- ggplot(data = got_nrc_n5, aes(x = reorder(word,n), y = n, fill = sentiment)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~sentiment, ncol = 2, scales = "free") +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Word", y = "count")

# Show it
got_nrc_gg

# Save it
ggsave(plot = got_nrc_gg, 
       here("figures","ipcc_nrc_sentiment.png"), 
       height = 8, 
       width = 5)


```


## Conclusions

The Game of Thrones books overall sentiment has a mean of -0.5419666 on a scale of -5 to 5 based on the AFINN lexicon, indicating a slightly negative sentiment. The most common emotions are positive, negative, trust, and fear. However, some of the most common words are rather ambiguous in sentiment. For example, lord is associated with trust, disgust, positivity, and negativity, when in the context of a fantasy book, it is mostly used a title with an arguably neutral sentiment. Another interesting outliar is the word horse being associated with trust.
